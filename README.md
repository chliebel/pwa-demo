# Progressive Web App Demo

This is a demo showing some features of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Service Workers, including:

* offline support (caches the home and info pages offline)
* notifications
* push support (there’s no server component yet)
* manifest
* deep-links

This demo is far from being feature-complete: As PWA and Service Workers are gradually moving forward, this demo will be updated over time.

## Use Case

This demo features a custom-built Single-Page Application (SPA) following the Material Design guidelines mapped to the use case of being a city guide for the city of Karlsruhe, Germany.
In fact, currently it doesn’t tell much about Karlsruhe.
