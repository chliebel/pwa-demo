# Progressive Web App Demo

This is a demo showing some features of Progressive Web Apps (PWA) and Service Workers, including:

* offline support (caches the home and info pages offline)
* notifications
* push support (thereâ€™s no server component yet)
* manifest

This demo does not claim to be feature-complete. As PWA and Service Workers are gradually moving forward, this demo will be updated over time.
